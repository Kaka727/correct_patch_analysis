# correct_patch_analysis
We dissect 177 correct patches generated by APR techniques and make some analysis.


The file userstudy_result records our user study result for the 173 patches we collected. We only show the results of patches different from the developer-provided ones since the results of patches the same as developer-provided ones are all Y.

The file distribution_result records the distribution situations of the correct patches over Defects4J projects and APR techniques.

The file characteristics_analysis records the six characteristics (patch size, number of chunks, number of modified files, number of modified methods, line coverage, and branch coverage) of each bug in our study.
